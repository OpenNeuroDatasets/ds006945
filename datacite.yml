title: "Dataset: T1-Weighted Structural MRI and fMRI of Participants Viewing Self-Avatar Exoskeleton Walking (11 SWS Cycles)”

description: "This dataset contains multimodal neuroimaging recordings from five healthy adult participants performing kinesthetic motor imagery (KI) of walking versus standing while viewing a first-person exoskeleton video stimulus consisting of 11 stop–walk–stop cycles. The dataset includes structural MRI, task-based fMRI, and EEG recordings and is organized according to the BIDS 1.8.0 specification. MRI sessions were conducted after participants completed nine longitudinal sessions of EEG-controlled exoskeleton walking and standing experiments (data shared as https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds006940). The dataset is released under a CC0 license and is intended to support research in motor imagery, gait neurophysiology, brain–machine interface–driven rehabilitation, and multimodal neuroimaging."
